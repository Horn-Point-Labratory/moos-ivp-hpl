# Important
#=============================================================================
This reposistory uses resources from other 3rd party MOOS Apps:

iRecon: comes from the moos-ivp-remus tree, we've made minor tweaks to it but
        remains largely unchanged. original files can be found at:
	http://oceanai.mit.edu/moos-ivp/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Tree.Remus

iWhoiMicroModem/lib_YellowSubUtil: comes from the moos-ivp-uidaho tree, minor
        changes were made to get the libraries to build correctly on our system.
	the original files can be found at:

#=============================================================================
# Introduction
#=============================================================================
This is a collection of MOOS-ivp applications and behaviors that were
developed by and for the University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory, as well
as UC Santa Barbara's Coastal Oceanography and Autonomous Systems Laboratory.
The code is definitely a little rough in a few places, and in many cases be
considered 'under development' or incomplete.

Most of the code was either written by Sean Gillen (sgillen@umd.edu), Nick
Nidzieko, or Christopher Moran (christophermoran@ucsb.edu). You can direct
questions about the code to Sean or Chris, although it's recommended to check
the last contributor on the code of interest.

#=============================================================================
# Directory Structure
#=============================================================================
The directory structure for the moos-ivp-ucsb is described below:

bin              - Directory for generated executable files
build            - Directory for build object files
build.sh         - Script for building moos-ivp-extend
CMakeLists.txt   - CMake configuration file for the project
lib              - Directory for generated library files
README           - Contains helpful information - (this file).
src              - Directory for source code
missions         - Directory containing code (.bhv, .moos files) for various
                   missions

#=============================================================================
# Build Instructions
#=============================================================================

To build on Linux and Apple platforms, execute the build script within this
directory:

   $ ./build.sh

To build without using the supplied script, execute the following commands
within this directory:

   $ cd build
   $ cmake ../
   $ make
   $ cd ..


#=============================================================================
# Environment variables
#=============================================================================
The moos-ivp-ucsb binaries files should be added to your path to allow them
to be launched from pAntler.

In order for generated IvP Behaviors to be recognized by the IvP Helm, you
should add the library directory to the "IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIRS" environment
variable.
